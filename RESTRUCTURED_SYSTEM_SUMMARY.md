## 🎯 **BUSINESS VISION & LOGIC**

**ProductivityFlow** is a **team productivity monitoring platform** designed for simplicity and efficiency:

### **🏢 How It Works**
1. **Team Owner** creates a team and gets two codes:
   - **Employee Code**: For workers to join and track productivity
   - **Manager Code**: For managers to oversee the team

2. **Employees** use the Employee Tracker app with the Employee Code
3. **Managers** use the Manager Dashboard with the Manager Code  
4. **Owner** has full access to everything including billing

5. View generated team codes:
   - Employee Code: Share with workers
   - Manager Code: Share with managers
6. Sign in to access full dashboard
7. Manage team, view analytics, handle billing
```
