# üêõ Bug Fixes Summary - ProductivityFlow v3.1.0

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Team Creation Bug - FIXED
**Problem**: When creating a new team, members from previously selected teams were being incorrectly added to the new team.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was not properly handling the team creation response and was mixing data between teams.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `manager-dashboard-tauri/src/pages/TeamManagement.tsx` to properly extract team data from the backend response
- Fixed team creation to use the actual `employee_code` from the backend instead of generating a fake code
- Ensured proper team isolation in the frontend state management

**Files Modified**:
- `manager-dashboard-tauri/src/pages/TeamManagement.tsx`

### 2. ‚úÖ Employee Login/Signup Issues - FIXED
**Problem**: Employee authentication was not working properly due to mismatched login methods.

**Root Cause**: The employee onboarding was creating users via `/api/teams/join` with default passwords, but the login was expecting email/password combinations.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `/api/auth/employee-login` endpoint to support both login methods:
  - Method 1: Email/Password login (for users with proper accounts)
  - Method 2: Team Code/Name login (for users created via team join)
- Updated employee onboarding to use the new team code/name login method
- Fixed authentication flow to work seamlessly with both signup and login

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/application.py` - Enhanced employee login endpoint
- `employee-tracker-tauri/src/components/OnboardingView.tsx` - Updated login method

### 3. ‚úÖ Test Data Persistence Issue - FIXED
**Problem**: Test users (John Doe, Jane Smith, Mike Johnson) were appearing in all teams, causing cross-contamination.

**Root Cause**: The setup script was creating test users that persisted across all teams, and there was no cleanup mechanism.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created comprehensive cleanup script (`backend/cleanup_test_data.py`)
- Added team deletion functionality to remove problematic teams
- Implemented proper team member removal functionality
- Created clean team creation process

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/application.py` - Added delete team and remove member endpoints
- `backend/cleanup_test_data.py` - New cleanup script
- `manager-dashboard-tauri/src/pages/TeamManagement.tsx` - Added delete team UI

### 4. ‚úÖ Missing Team Management Features - FIXED
**Problem**: No ability to delete teams with confirmation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `DELETE /api/teams/<team_id>` endpoint for team deletion
- Added `DELETE /api/teams/<team_id>/members/<user_id>` endpoint for member removal
- Implemented confirmation dialogs in the UI
- Added delete buttons with proper styling and icons
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/application.py` - Added delete endpoints
- `manager-dashboard-tauri/src/pages/TeamManagement.tsx` - Added delete UI and functionality

### 5. ‚úÖ Email Verification & Password Reset - FIXED
**Problem**: Email verification and forgot password functionality was not working.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` endpoint for password reset requests
- Added `POST /api/auth/reset-password` endpoint for password reset with token
- Added `POST /api/auth/verify-email` endpoint for email verification
- Enhanced User model with reset token and email verification fields
- Added proper validation and security measures

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/application.py` - Added authentication endpoints and User model enhancements
