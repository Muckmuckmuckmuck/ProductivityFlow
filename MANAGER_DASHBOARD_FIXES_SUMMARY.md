## ✅ **Fixes Implemented:**

### **1. Authentication Flow Fix**
**Problem**: Users were auto-logged in after account creation
**Solution**: Implemented proper authentication flow:
```
Create Account → Email Verification → Sign In → Dashboard
```

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `AuthView.tsx` to prevent auto-login after account creation
- Added email verification step between account creation and sign-in
- Added verification code input form
- Implemented proper state management for verification flow

### **2. Email Verification Implementation**
**Problem**: No email verification system
**Solution**: Added complete email verification flow

**Frontend Changes** (`AuthView.tsx`):
- Added `showEmailVerification` state
- Added `verificationCode` input field
- Added `handleEmailVerification()` function
- Added verification UI with proper styling
- Added verification code input with 6-digit limit

**Backend Changes** (`application.py`):
- Added `/api/auth/verify-email` endpoint
- Implemented verification logic
- Added proper error handling
- Returns JWT token after successful verification

### **3. Team Creation Authorization Fix**
**Problem**: Team creation requests missing Authorization headers
**Solution**: Added proper Authorization headers to all API requests

**Changes Made** (`TeamManagement.tsx`):
- Added `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header to team creation requests
- Added Authorization header to team loading requests
- Fixed authentication token retrieval from localStorage

### **4. API Request Improvements**
**Problem**: Inconsistent API request headers
**Solution**: Standardized all API requests with proper headers

**Fixed Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/teams` - Team creation
- `GET /api/teams` - Team loading
- `GET /api/teams/{id}/members` - Team members loading

## 🔄 **New Authentication Flow:**

### **Step 1: Create Account**
1. User fills out registration form
2. System validates input (email, password, name, organization)
3. Account is created in database
4. User is shown email verification screen

### **Step 2: Email Verification**
1. User enters 6-digit verification code
2. System verifies code against backend
3. If valid, user is redirected to sign-in form
4. If invalid, error message is shown

### **Step 3: Sign In**
1. User enters email and password
2. System authenticates credentials
3. JWT token is generated and stored
4. User is redirected to dashboard

### **Step 4: Dashboard Access**
1. User can now access all manager features
2. Team creation works with proper authorization
3. All API requests include authentication headers

## 🛠️ **Technical Details:**

### **Frontend Changes:**
```typescript
// New state variables
const [showEmailVerification, setShowEmailVerification] = useState(false);
const [verificationCode, setVerificationCode] = useState("");
const [isVerifying, setIsVerifying] = useState(false);

// New verification function
const handleEmailVerification = async () => {
  // Sends verification code to backend
  // Handles success/error responses
  // Redirects to sign-in on success
};
```

### **Backend Changes:**
```python
@application.route('/api/auth/verify-email', methods=['POST'])
def verify_email():
    # Validates email and verification code
    # Creates JWT token for verified user
    # Returns user data and token
```

### **API Headers Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (missing authorization)
headers: JSON.stringify({
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
})

// After (with authorization)
headers: JSON.stringify({
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
})
```
