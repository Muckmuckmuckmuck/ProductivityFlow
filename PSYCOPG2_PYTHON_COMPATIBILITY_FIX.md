# psycopg2 Python 3.13 Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The Render deployment was failing with the following error:
```
ImportError: /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
```

This was caused by a compatibility issue between:
- **psycopg2-binary version 2.9.9**
- **Python 3.13** (which Render was using by default)

## Root Cause
- psycopg2-binary 2.9.9 was compiled for older Python versions
- Python 3.13 has internal changes that break the compiled binary
- Render was defaulting to Python 3.13 despite runtime.txt specifying 3.11.8

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Python Version (render.yaml)
Added explicit Python version specification:
```yaml
pythonVersion: "3.11.8"
```

### 2. Confirmed psycopg2-binary Version (requirements.txt)
Kept psycopg2-binary==2.9.9 which is compatible with Python 3.11.8:
```
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
```

### 3. Runtime.txt Already Correct
The backend/runtime.txt was already set to:
```
python-3.11.8
```

## Changes Made

### render.yaml
```yaml
# Before
runtime: python

# After  
runtime: python
pythonVersion: "3.11.8"
```

### requirements.txt
```txt
# Confirmed version
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
```

## Result
- Render will now use Python 3.11.8 instead of 3.13
- psycopg2-binary will install and work correctly
- Database connections will function properly
- No more undefined symbol errors

## Commit
- Commit: `67fee6e`
- Message: "Fix psycopg2 Python 3.13 compatibility issue for Render deployment"
- Pushed to GitHub and ready for Render deployment

## Expected Outcome
The backend should now deploy successfully on Render with:
- Python 3.11.8 runtime
- Working psycopg2-binary installation
- Successful database connections
- All previous fixes (Anthropic client, etc.) still in place
