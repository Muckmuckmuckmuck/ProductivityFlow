# pg8000 PostgreSQL Adapter Fix

## Issue
The Render deployment was still failing with the same psycopg2 error:
```
ImportError: /opt/render/project/src/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyInterpreterState_Get
```

This was happening because:
- Render was still using Python 3.13 despite our configuration attempts
- psycopg2-binary 2.9.9 is not compatible with Python 3.13
- The compiled binary extensions were failing to load

## Root Cause
- psycopg2-binary requires compiled C extensions
- Python 3.13 has internal changes that break these compiled extensions
- Render was not respecting the Python version configuration

## Solution Applied

### 1. Switched to pg8000 (requirements.txt)
Replaced psycopg2-binary with pg8000:
```txt
# Before
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9

# After
pg8000>=1.29.0
```

### 2. Updated Database URL (application.py)
Modified database URL to use pg8000 dialect:
```python
# Before
if DATABASE_URL.startswith("postgres://"):
    DATABASE_URL = DATABASE_URL.replace("postgres://", "postgresql://", 1)

# After
if DATABASE_URL.startswith("postgres://"):
    DATABASE_URL = DATABASE_URL.replace("postgres://", "postgresql+pg8000://", 1)
elif DATABASE_URL.startswith("postgresql://"):
    DATABASE_URL = DATABASE_URL.replace("postgresql://", "postgresql+pg8000://", 1)
```

### 3. Added Runtime Configuration
- Created `runtime.txt` in root directory: `python-3.11.8`
- Added `buildFilter` to `render.yaml` for better build control

## Why pg8000?
- **Pure Python**: No compiled C extensions required
- **Python 3.13 Compatible**: Works with all Python versions
- **SQLAlchemy Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Production Ready**: Used in many production applications

## Changes Made

### requirements.txt
```txt
pg8000>=1.29.0  # Pure Python PostgreSQL adapter
```

### application.py
```python
# Database URL now uses pg8000 dialect
DATABASE_URL = DATABASE_URL.replace("postgres://", "postgresql+pg8000://", 1)
```

### runtime.txt (root)
```txt
python-3.11.8
```

### render.yaml
```yaml
buildFilter:
  paths:
    - backend/**
```

## Result
- No more compiled extension issues
- Compatible with Python 3.13 (if Render still uses it)
- Compatible with Python 3.11.8 (if Render respects runtime.txt)
- Pure Python solution with no binary dependencies

## Commit
- Commit: `13e23b3`
- Message: "Fix PostgreSQL adapter compatibility with Python 3.13"
- Pushed to GitHub and ready for Render deployment

## Expected Outcome
The backend should now deploy successfully on Render with:
- Working PostgreSQL connections using pg8000
- No more undefined symbol errors
- Compatible with any Python version Render uses
- All previous fixes (Anthropic client, etc.) still in place
