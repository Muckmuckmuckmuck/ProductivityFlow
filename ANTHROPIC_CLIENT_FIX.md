# Anthropic Client Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The Render deployment was failing with the following error:
```
TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

This was caused by a compatibility issue between the Anthropic library (0.7.8) and the httpx library version that was being installed.

## Root Cause
- The Anthropic library was trying to pass a `proxies` parameter to the httpx Client
- The newer version of httpx doesn't accept this parameter
- This caused the client initialization to fail during deployment

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Dependencies (requirements.txt)
Added explicit httpx version for compatibility:
```
httpx==0.24.1
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling (application.py)
- Added try-catch around Claude client initialization
- Added null check before using claude_client
- Graceful fallback when Claude client is not available

### 3. Changes Made
```python
# Before
claude_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=claude_api_key)

# After
try:
    claude_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=claude_api_key)
    logging.info("Claude client initialized successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Failed to initialize Claude client: {e}")
    claude_client = None

# Added null check before usage
if not claude_client:
    return {
        'summary': "AI analysis unavailable - Claude client not initialized",
        'input_tokens': 0,
        'output_tokens': 0,
        'cost': 0,
        'irregularity_detected': False
    }, None
```

## Result
- Backend will now deploy successfully on Render
- AI features will work when Claude API key is available
- Graceful degradation when Claude client is not available
- No more deployment failures due to httpx compatibility issues
