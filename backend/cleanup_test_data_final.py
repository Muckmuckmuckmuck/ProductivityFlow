## Issues Found

### 1. Test Users in Every Team
The following test users appear in every team and need to be removed:
- John Doe (Developer)
- Jane Smith (Designer) 
- Mike Johnson (Manager)

### 2. Team Deletion Issues
- Team deletion requires proper manager authentication
- Removed users need to be logged out from employee tracker
- Cascade deletion needs to be implemented

### 3. Data Integrity Issues
- Test data mixed with real data
- Hardcoded test users in API responses
- Inconsistent user management

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Remove all test users** from existing teams
2. **Fix team deletion endpoint** to handle authentication properly
3. **Implement proper user removal** with logout functionality
4. **Clean up hardcoded test data** in API responses

### Long-term Actions:
1. **Implement proper data isolation** between teams
2. **Add user session management** for removed users
3. **Create data migration scripts** for production
4. **Add data validation** to prevent test data contamination

## Clean Teams Created

## Next Steps

1. Use the clean teams for testing
2. Implement proper user removal functionality
3. Fix team deletion authentication
4. Add user session management
5. Deploy fixes to production
